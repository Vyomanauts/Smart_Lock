ðŸ”’ Smart Lock System

The Smart Lock System is a secure and versatile locking mechanism that integrates RFID technology, a keypad, and a display to provide enhanced security and convenience. This system allows access through a two-step authentication process: scanning an RFID card followed by entering a passcode on the keypad.

Key Features
RFID Authentication: Scan an RFID card to initiate the authentication process. The system reads the RFID tag and verifies the user's identity.
Keypad Input: Enter a passcode on the keypad displayed on the screen. The passcode is required to unlock the system, ensuring an additional layer of security.
Display: Provides real-time feedback and instructions, such as prompts for entering the passcode or alerts if the RFID scan is unsuccessful.
LED Indicators: Two LEDs signal the system's status. One LED indicates successful access, while the other signals an error or incorrect passcode entry.
Tech Stack
RFID Reader: For scanning RFID cards.
Keypad: For entering the passcode.
Display: For user feedback and instructions.
LEDs: For status indication.
System Operation
RFID Scan: The user scans their RFID card. If the RFID card is recognized, the system prompts the user to enter the passcode.
Passcode Entry: The user enters the passcode on the keypad. The system verifies the passcode.
Access Granted/Denied: If both RFID and passcode are correct, the system unlocks. If either is incorrect, it alerts the user with the LED indicators.
